Instead, it turned out to be a colossal disappointment. The additional charges to fix its constant glitches and defects drained my wallet even more. I spend 275 $ to get a new battery. The final straw was when the phone's camera malfunctioned, and the repair cost was astronomical. I demand a full refund and an apology for this abysmal product.

I had to shell out an additional $200 for a replacement battery, but it barely made a difference. To add insult to injury, the camera failed within a month, and the repair cost was an absurd $400!

The camera stopped functioning properly, and the repair quote was a shocking $500! I demand an apology for this pitiful excuse of a phone.\n",
