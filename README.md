**Prompt Engineering**
Prompt Engineering is the art and science of designing inputs (prompts) that guide an AI model (like GPT, Claude, Gemini) to produce the best possible output.

Since LLMs (Large Language Models) don't "understand" things like humans — they predict based on patterns — the way you ask dramatically affects the quality of the answer.

**Why is Prompt Engineering Important?**
1.LLMs are powerful but sensitive to how you ask.

2.Small changes in the prompt = BIG changes in results.

3.Better prompts → Better performance → Saves post-processing, cost, and improves user experience.

4.Essential for building GenAI apps, agents, RAG pipelines, chatbots, etc.

**Key Concepts of Prompt Engineering**
1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Be clear, detailed, and explicit about what you want.

Vague prompts = unpredictable or generic answers.

Bad: "Tell me about space."
Good: "Summarize the history of NASA’s Apollo missions in less than 100 words."

2. **Instruction Following**
Modern LLMs are tuned to follow instructions.

Writing prompts like commands or job descriptions improves results.

"Summarize the meeting notes into 3 key action items."

3. **Examples (Few-shot Prompting)**
Give 1–5 examples if you want the model to learn your style or task pattern.

"Format the following names alphabetically: John, Alice, Bob."
Now, format: Sam, Alex, Zoe.

4. **Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
Encourage the model to think step-by-step before answering.

Helps with math, logic, coding, complex questions.

"First, explain your reasoning, then provide the final answer."

5. **Role Prompting**
Assign the model a persona or role to shape the style/tone.

"You are a senior financial advisor. Suggest investment strategies for a beginner."

6. **Structured Outputs**
Tell the model how to format the output: JSON, table, bullet points, numbered lists.

"Respond in JSON format with fields: question, answer, confidence."

7. **Iterative Refinement (Prompt Chaining)**
Sometimes you break big tasks into multiple smaller prompts.

Example: first summarize a document, then extract key dates, then generate questions.

**Steps to Write a Good Prompt**
Define the Goal: What exact output do you want?

Be Clear About Format: Free-text, JSON, list, etc.

Set the Role and Context: ("You are an expert travel agent.")

Use Examples if Needed: Few-shot examples make behavior consistent.

Test and Refine: Small changes → Large impact → A/B testing is crucial.

Use Constraints: ("Answer in 3 bullet points", "No more than 100 words.")
